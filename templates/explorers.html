            <h1>Explorer Personality Type</h1>
            <p> Last but not least, explorers have the personality traits Observing and Prospecting in common. They tend to be quick on their feet and live for uncertain situations as they are flexible, spontaneous and impulsive by nature. Explorers are rarely perfectionists, they’d rather see a job get done than dwell on the details. Their free-form attitude can make explorers very fun people to be around. They usually have little to no reservations when it comes to trying out new things and love sharing their experiences with friends. The four explorer personalities are:</p>

            <p> <b>1. Virtuosos (ISTP)</b> are curious yet rational individuals who love learning on the go and taking on new projects. They tend to be friendly but also keep to themselves, their struggle to stay focused on one subject makes them unpredictable.</p>
            <p> <b>2. Adventurers (ISFP)</b> are happy with who they are, creative, introverted, passionate people. They’d rather create experiences and enjoy their current life than plan their future.</p>
            <p> <b>3. Entrepreneurs (ESTP)</b> love to entertain others with their blunt humor and are never shy to volunteer for an opportunity to stand in the spotlight. They’re energetic and intelligent but also tend to take the leap instead of planning out their every step.</p>
            <p> <b>4. Entertainers (ESFP)</b> will spend the majority of their time using their observant talent to encourage others. While they often struggle to keep their ducks in a row, entertainers are a true pleasure to be around. </p>
